# Recursive Fibonacci Number Generator

This Python script generates a series of Fibonacci numbers using a recursive algorithm. It allows you to specify the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate and displays the resulting series. The script uses memoization to optimize the recursive calculations.

## Usage

1. Run the script.

2. Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers you want to generate when prompted.

The script will then:

- Check if the input is a positive integer.
- Generate a list of Fibonacci numbers using a recursive function with memoization.
- Display the generated Fibonacci series.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```
Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate: 10
Fibonacci Series:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

In this example, the script generates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

## Note

- This script uses recursion and memoization to calculate Fibonacci numbers. Memoization helps improve the efficiency of the calculations by storing previously computed Fibonacci numbers and reusing them when needed.

- Make sure to input a positive integer for the number of Fibonacci numbers you want to generate.

- You can modify and integrate this script into your projects as needed.
